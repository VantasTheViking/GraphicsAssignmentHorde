For all of the shaders, I've modified them to have modifiable colours instead of textures as I can't make my own due to lack of skill in terms of using art programs. I used specular and diffuse wrapping on more important objects like doors to make them stand out to the rest of the scene. I also used a combination of the hologram/transparent rim lighting shader with a standard rim lighting shader we have made with class but modified to accept colours to have a modifiable inner colour to create the radiation tube which would fit our underground secret lab with escaped test subjects theme.
